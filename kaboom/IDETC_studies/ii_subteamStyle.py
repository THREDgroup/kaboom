Compare the effect of style on performance for each sub-team of car problem

This experiment addresses the question:
Do certain sub-teams of the car problem favor a KAI style?

WARNING: This could take a long time and a lot of computational power.
Consider running  on a server. Set numberOfCores to the number of parallel
comupting nodes/cores available. The simulation can be run in parallel up to
 p.reps times (= 16 by default)

The results are plotted and saved to /results/subteam_plots folder
